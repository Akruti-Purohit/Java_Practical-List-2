/*Create a class called “Perdon” with the following attributes:
    Name (string)
     Age(int)
 Address (string)
 The class should have a constructor that accepts all
three attributes and initializes them appropriately. It
should also have getter and setter methods for each
attribute, and a method called “introduce” that
prints out the person’s name, age and address in a
formatted string. */
